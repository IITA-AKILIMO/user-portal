= Loading Case 1: No Loading Icon + Long Message: =
dFlip 3D Flipbook WordPress Usage & FAQs 1
If you see the loading message and don’t see a loading icon. Then the issue is related to code execution.

1. Cause A – Other plugin error: DearFlip uses jQuery to start the plugin and if other jQuery plugins cause any errors, the execution of DearFlip is also disturbed. The flipbook never advances further and is stuck at the initial loading message. Check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors.
2. Cause B – WordPress 5.5 update: This is similar to cause A. With WordPress 5.5, jQuery got updated and many other plugins failed, and that results in cause A. So check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors.
3. Cause C – DearFlip error: Check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors. If the error displayed is from dflip.min.js then report it using the contact lite support button below.


= Loading Case 2: Loading Icon + Loading Message: =
This is a normal case and the messages are displayed as the resources and files are loaded.

= Loading Case 3: Loading stuck at certain Message: =
This happens when the related file for loading is missing or inaccessible. For the best results, we recommend using(hosting) the files from the same domain. Check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors. If there are errors please report it using the contact lite support button below.

= Loading Case 4: Cannot access File: =
Make sure the file is accessible. Try opening the link in browser opening a new tab and inserting the PDF URL – see if it opens. Make sure it opens.

1. Cause A – File is not available: Filename is mistaken or not added at all.
2. Cause B – CORS Issue: This happens a lot when users don’t understand what files access means in the modern web. PDF files are not accessible from one domain to another just like that. They require permission. You need to set proper CORS permission into the domain where the PDF files exist, so that your domain can access it. NOTE: PDF files from online file-sharing servers like Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox cannot be configured for CORS access. They won’t allow it.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install DearFlip 3D flipbook in my WordPress site? =

Please check the installation tab for details.


= How many pages can 3D Flipbook support and how big the PDF file can be? =

DearFlip 3D Flipbook uses PDF.js to render the PDF pages. At any given time it requires only 6 pages of data at max. So the amount of pages in a PDF file doesn't really affect the 3D Flipbook. Also, it only loads 6 Pages of data to start the flipbook and this makes it resource friendly and traffic friendly 3D flipbook. Other 3D flipbook might crash with huge files, DearFlip will last longer.

4. Upload the PDF file if you have not uploaded already and select the PDF file
4. CLick on **'Publish'** button and the page should save and reload


= Creating a 3D Flipbook WordPress Post with Images =

1. Goto **'dFlip Books > Add New Book'**
2. Enter the title of the 3D Flipbook in Title box
3. In 'Book Source Type' select 'Images' to create a WordPress Flipbook from images
4. Click on **'Add new Page'** button and select the images you want to use for creating your 3D Flipbook WordPress post
5. Arrange the order of images by dragging the images left or right
4. Click on **'Publish'** button and the page should save and reload

= Adding Flipbook to a WordPress Page =

1. From the 3D Flipbook you just created, copy the shortcode from **'Shortcode'** box. Similar to [dflip id="525"][/dflip]
2. Goto the page where you want to insert the flipbook and paste the shortcode


= Creating a PDF Flipbook with just PDF File URL =

You can create a flipbook with just the link and without creating the dFlip post
1. Goto the page where you want to create a flipbook from pdf
2. Use a shortcode to embed the flipbook: **[dflip source="example.com/wp-content/uploads/file.pdf"]**
 **source** is the link to the PDF file that you want to convert to Flipbook


= PDF links are not working! =

1. PDF links are premium feature in DearFlip, and won't be displayed in lite version of DearFlip 3D Flipbook WordPress Plugin. You can test your PDF links to check how they work in our online [PDF Flipbook Viewer](https://dearflip.com/go/wp-lite-pdf-viewer).
2. Also pay attention that some desktop readers' auto convert URL texts to link and give an assumption that those are links. Such links won't work in every reader and devices. One of the popular case is Adobe PDF Reader: it auto-converts the text URLs to links in desktop but doesn't in mobile app. So we suggest defining links explicitly and not rely on PDF reader's auto conversion capability.

= Start or open 3D Flipbook at certain page? =

You can set the opening page of a flipbook with shortcode:
**<code>[dflip id="123" data-page=5]</code>**
This will create your PDF flipbook or image flipbook to open at page 5 when it starts.
